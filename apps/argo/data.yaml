description: |
  Argo CD is an open-source tool for implementing GitOps in Kubernetes. It automates the deployment and lifecycle management of applications by continuously synchronizing the desired state declared in a Git repository with the live state in the cluster. k0rdent integration:

  - Centralized Management: Manage Argo CD instances and application deployments across multiple clusters from the K0rdent control plane. 
  - Simplified Deployment: k0rdent can automate the deployment and configuration of Argo CD in your clusters, reducing manual effort.
  - Policy-Driven Deployments: Leverage k0rdent's policy engine to enforce security and compliance policies for your Argo CD deployments and application configurations.
