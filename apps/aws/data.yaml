description: |
  k0rdent, as a multi-cluster Kubernetes management platform, integrates with AWS to provide a seamless experience for managing and deploying Kubernetes clusters and applications on the AWS cloud. Here's how this integration works:

  - Cluster Deployment: k0rdent can deploy Kubernetes clusters on AWS using CAPI. 
  - Infrastructure Management: k0rdent can provision and manage AWS infrastructure resources, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, and security groups, required for your Kubernetes clusters.
  - Centralized Management: Manage your AWS-based Kubernetes clusters from the k0rdent control plane, along with clusters on other platforms.
  - Cost Optimization: k0rdent can provide insights into your AWS spending and help you optimize resource allocation for your Kubernetes deployments.
  - Security and Compliance: k0rdent integrates with AWS security services to ensure your Kubernetes clusters and applications are secure and compliant with industry standards.
